                        Our mini-hackathon takes place once a semester and lasts 12 hours (10am to 10pm). While members are encouraged to attend,
                        they are not required to. We occasionally have additional events, such as company campus tours, which are optional and last about 1-2 hours.

                        name into our special attendance raffle. At the end of the semester, we give out three great prizes by drawing
                        names from the raffle pool. The more you attend, the larger chance you have to win! You can see last year's

                        Unfortunately, no. The University of Wisconsin-Madison actively discourages registered student organizations (RSOs) from
                        filing for non-profit <br>(aka 501(c)(3)) status due to the complicated and lengthy nature of the process. However, be ensured that all RSOs
                        must operate under a "not-for-profit" model, including the SDC.
